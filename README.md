# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is a submission of Chamila Perera for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. This shows the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

### Dataset
[Recognition of human activity using smart phones.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones/)

### Files
- CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and all the transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.
- run_analysis.R is followed by 5 steps required in the course projectâ€™s definition for data preparation:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- FinalTidyData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
